# Isabelle Course Material

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www21.in.tum.de/teaching/semantics/">Semantics via Isabelle</a>, Tobias Nipkow
        <p>
        This is an MSc course on Semantics via Isabelle, 15 weeks with two 90 minutes lectures per week.

        <a href="http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/teaching/ss11/eve">Isabelle/HOL + Isar course</a>, Christian Sternagel, 4 sessions of 3h
        <p>
        This is the course materials for a blocked Isabelle course that Christian Sternagel held in Innsbruck several times. The course is loosely based on Tobias Nipkow's course and the Tutorial but avoids apply-style and concentrates on Isar.

        <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/celtique/genet/ACF/">ACF: Software Formal Analysis and Design</a>, Thomas Genet, 6 lectures and 10 lab sessions
        <p>
        The lecture notes are (almost) in english, the lab notes are in french. This course focuses on functional programming (Isabelle/HOL and Scala), first order logic (for defining program properties) and on counterexample finding (rather than on proof). The final objective is to run Java+Scala programs with verified blocks, i.e. whose formally defined properties have been checked on the Isabelle theory using counterexample finders.

        <a href="http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/isabelle/Isabelle_Primer.pdf">Isabelle Primer for Mathematicians</a>, Bogdan Grechuk
        <p>
        This is a quick introduction to the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant, aimed at mathematicians who would like to use it for the formalization of mathematical results.
