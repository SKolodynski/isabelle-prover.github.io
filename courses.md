# Isabelle Course Material

 - [Semantics via Isabelle](https://www21.in.tum.de/teaching/semantics/), Tobias Nipkow
   
   This is an MSc course on Semantics via Isabelle based on the [Concrete Semantics](https://concrete-semantics.in.tum.de/) book,
   15 weeks with two 90 minutes lectures per week.

- [Functional Data Structures](https://www21.in.tum.de/teaching/fds)

  This is a course about functional data structures using Isabelle, based on material in the
  [Functional Algorithms, Verified!](https://functional-algorithms-verified.org/) book.
  15 weeks with one 90 minute lecture per week.

 - [Isabelle/HOL + Isar course](http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/teaching/ss11/eve), Christian Sternagel, 4 sessions of 3h
   
   This is the course materials for a blocked Isabelle course that Christian Sternagel held in Innsbruck several times.
   The course is loosely based on Tobias Nipkow's course and the Tutorial but avoids apply-style and concentrates on Isar.
   
 - [ACF: Software Formal Analysis and Design](http://www.irisa.fr/celtique/genet/ACF/), Thomas Genet, 6 lectures and 10 lab sessions
   <p>
   The lecture notes are (almost) in english, the lab notes are in french.
   This course focuses on functional programming (Isabelle/HOL and Scala),
   first order logic (for defining program properties) and on counterexample finding (rather than on proof).
   The final objective is to run Java+Scala programs with verified blocks,
   i.e. whose formally defined properties have been checked on the Isabelle theory using counterexample finders.
   
 - [Isabelle Primer for Mathematicians](http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/isabelle/Isabelle_Primer.pdf), Bogdan Grechuk
   
   This is a quick introduction to the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant,
   aimed at mathematicians who would like to use it for the formalization of mathematical results.
